I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.

It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.

My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.

The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.

The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.

In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.

Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core.
